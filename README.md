# Piggybank Code Guide

This repo houses our Piggybank Code Guide. It contains info on writing [SCSS](https://github.com/getpiggybank/code-guide/tree/master/SCSS), [JS](https://github.com/getpiggybank/code-guide/tree/master/JS), [JSON](https://github.com/getpiggybank/code-guide/tree/master/JSON), and more. The goal of the repo is to keep code consistent, leave you with less guessing, and more time coding.

## Editor Setup

Unless where otherwise stated, Piggybank has the following setup in our editors: 

- Spaces, not tabs
- 2 spaces per indent

## Contributing

Each category should be it's own folder with a README.md. Creating folders for each category allows you to have sub-categories as well as extra information like example code directories or images.
